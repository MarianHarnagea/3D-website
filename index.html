                named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment
                analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.

                Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates
                analytical model building. Using algorithms that iteratively
                learn from data, machine learning allows computers to learn
                without being explicitly programmed where to look. The result?
                High-value predictions that can guide better decisions and smart
                actions in real time without human intervention.

                Researchers are now looking to apply these successes in pattern
                recognition to more complex tasks such as automatic language
                translation, medical diagnoses and numerous other important

                the world around them. Computer vision is the science that aims

                computer. Computer Vision typically refers to the scientific
                discipline of giving machines the ability of sight, or perhaps
                more colourfully, enabling machines to visually analyse their
                environments and the stimuli within them. This process typically
                involves the evaluation of an image, images or video.

                A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called
                blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each
                block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous
                block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains
                are inherently resistant to modification of the data.
